          <h5>10. Koenigsegg Jesko Absolut</h5>
          <p><b>Top speed: 310mph (in theory)
            <br>
            0-60mph: 2.5 seconds</b>
            <br>
            It'll come as no surprise that Koenigsegg has made this list twice, as they're very good at making bonkers hypercars. The Jesko Absolut gets a twin-turbocharged V8 with up to 1,600hp when it's running on E85 race fuel.
            <br>
    
            You might be wondering why, with a claimed top speed of 310mph, the Jesko Absolut isn't at the top of this list. Well, Koenigsegg hasn't actually tested the top speed in real life, but instead has only simulated it using a computer. You'll have to wait until it gets run for real before it can take the top spot.</p>

            <br>
            0-60mph: 2.5 seconds <br></b>
            
            In a world of downsizing and forced induction, the lunatics at Lamborghini have stuck with a naturally aspirated V12 for its new flagship Revuelto. That’s not to say it’s completely unassisted, as you also get three electric motors to boost the power.
            <br>
            Specifically, you get a combined 1,015hp, more than any road-going Lamborghini ever made. 0-60mph is dealt with in 2.5 seconds, and it’ll go on to a top speed of 217mph.

            Top speed: 238mph
          <br>
            0-60mph: 3.2 seconds <br> </b>
            
            The Pagani Huayra is a fantastic looking car. Every detail is exquisite, and it’s more than just a pin-up as well. It has an AMG derived twin-turbocharged V12 engine putting out 730hp and 1,000Nm of torque, enough for a top speed of 238mph.
            
            The Huayra is made mostly of carbon fibre to keep the weight down, as well as to make it more rigid, and it’s covered in active aero to help it slip through the air more easily.          </p>

          Matching the Speedtail is the Koenigsegg Regera. This Swedish speed machine comes with a twin-turbo V8 engine and an electric motor that produce a total of 1,500hp. <br>

Unlike any other car on this list, the Regera can go from 0-250mph using just ONE gear. Yep, no matter if you’re cruising at 30mph or aiming to hit its 250mph top speed (on a closed course, not the M1) you’ll be in the same gear. Seems a little bonkers.

            <br>
            0-60mph: 2.5 seconds<br></b>
            
            McLaren didn’t design the Speedtail to chase world records, but, with a 250mph top speed, it’s the fastest road car it has ever built.

            <br>
            That’s faster than its last three-seat car — the legendary McLaren F1. Its super-slippery bodywork lacks and drag-inducing wings and means it looks like something ripped straight from a futuristic cyberpunk film. Just think about carrying two of your mates at that speed…

            <br>
            0-60mph: 1.9 seconds

<br></b>
            
Electric cars offer instant acceleration thanks to the torque from their electric motors, however the added weight of the batteries can limit them in terms of top speed. This isn’t the case for the Rimac Nevera though.

            <br>
            This ballistic EV hypercar has four electric motors, producing a whopping 1,914hp and 2,300Nm of torque. That’s enough to launch it from 0-60mph in just 1.9 seconds, and it can go on to a top speed of 258mph. It’s made almost entirely out of carbon fibre to keep the weight down, but this isn’t just some stripped-out drag racer. The interior is a lovely place to be and you still get all the luxuries you’d expect of a car that costs £2 million.

            0-60mph: 2.6 seconds<br></b>
            
            The folks in the USA are smashing the top speed game recently, with third place going to another all-American supercar. The Hennessey Venom F5 has a 6.6-litre twin-turbocharged V8 with 1,817hp and 1,617Nm of torque.

            <br>
            That’s enough to launch it from 0-60mph in 2.6 seconds, and it’ll go onto a top speed of 272mph – for now. Hennessey want’s to get even more out of the F5, with the firm targeting a top speed of over 300mph.

          <h5>2. SSC Tuatara</h5>

            <br>
            0-60mph: 2.5 seconds<br></b>
            
            While the Bugatti Chiron’s complicated W16 engine is mightily impressive, sometimes you just can’t beat a whopping great V8 with a couple of turbos strapped to it. The SSC Tuatara (Too-ah-ta-ra) has a twin-turbocharged V8 which puts out up to 1,750hp when it’s running on ethanol,  however there is some controversy around the official top speed.
            <br>
            You see, SSC claimed the Tuatara actually managed 316mph in October 2020 to make it the world’s fastest car — but later admitted to a GPS error that depicted that speed wrongly. Tests in early 2023 saw the car hit an actual top speed of 295mph, not exactly slow.

          <h5>1. Bugatti Chiron Supersport 300+</h5>
          <p><b>Top speed: 304mph

            <br>
            0-60mph: 2.2 seconds

            <br></b>
            
            Those who grew up in the 2000s will probably associate the fastest car in the world with the legendary Bugatti Veyron. Well that car’s spirit has been carried over to the Bugatti Chiron Supersport 300+, an 8.0-litre quad turbocharged 1,600hp mega machine which will do, as the name suggests, over 300mph.
            <br>
            Specifically, it did 304mph when the French firm unleashed it at Volkswagen’s Ehra-Lessien test track. The Chiron 300+ doesn’t hold the official world record though, as it only did the run in one direction. To break the record you have to do it twice in opposite directions, which Bugatti decided not to do for some reason.
